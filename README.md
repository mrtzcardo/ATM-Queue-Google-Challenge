# ATM Queue

## Round F 2020 - Google Kick Start

### Problem

There are N people numbered from 1 to N, standing in a queue to withdraw money from an ATM. The queue is formed in ascending order of their number. The person numbered i wants to withdraw amount Ai. The maximum amount a person can withdraw at a time is X. If they need more money than X, they need to go stand at the end of the queue and wait for their turn in line. A person leaves the queue once they have withdrawn the required amount.

You need to find the order in which all the people leave the queue.
